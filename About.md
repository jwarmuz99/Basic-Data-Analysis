A bunch of basic data analysis projects based on an Udemy course 'Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp' by Jose Portilla [https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/].

The SF Salaries project includes a very basic data exploration, whereas the 911 Calls notebook shows a more detailed analysis of the dataset.
